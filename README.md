Scripts to easy join files and make the download from an web page
Proof of concept to make massive downloads from URLS joining two files.

The context for this script is :

 - we have one textfile with index nums
 - we have one textfile with filenames (with spaces)
 
We need to get both make an bash array and joining together to make a URL for download.
